# üì¶ packinstall

**A universal Bash script to simplify package installation across diverse Linux distributions.**

`packinstall` automatically detects your Linux distribution and uses the appropriate package manager (like `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `zypper`, `emerge`, or `apk`) to install the specified package. Say goodbye to remembering specific commands for each distro!

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automatic Distribution Detection:** Identifies your OS (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, OpenSUSE, Gentoo, Alpine).
* **Package Manager Agnostic:** Translates a simple `packinstall <package>` into the correct command for your system.
* **Pre-installation Updates:** Automatically updates package lists where necessary (e.g., `apt update`, `pacman -Sy`).
* **Lightweight & Fast:** A single Bash script with no external dependencies (beyond standard system tools).
* **Easy to Use:** Simple command-line interface.

## üöÄ Installation

The easiest way to install `packinstall` is to use the provided `install.sh` script. This script will download `packinstall` and place it in `/usr/local/bin/` so you can run it from anywhere.

1.  **Open your terminal.**
2.  **Download and run the installer script:**

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/packinstall/main/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/packinstall/main/install.sh) | bash
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!)*

3.  **Verify installation:**
    ```bash
    packinstall --version # (Optional: if you add a --version flag to your script later)
    ```
    Or just try installing a package:
    ```bash
    packinstall htop
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Once installed, simply run `packinstall` followed by the name of the package you wish to install:

```bash
packinstall <package_name>
